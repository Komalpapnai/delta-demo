The Studentsâ€™ Streamlined Grievance Management System is a web-based application designed to provide students with a transparent, efficient, and structured platform to raise and resolve grievances within educational institutions.

The system replaces outdated paper-based processes with a digital, user-friendly platform that allows students to lodge complaints, track their status, and receive timely updates. On the administrator side, a hierarchical console enables department, college, and university-level administrators to review, manage, and resolve issues effectively.
